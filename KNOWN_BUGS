1) Flutescale.py used to work. Now it doesn't. Not sure why?
2) Sometimes the sound output is garbled. Just re-running the script usually fixes it.
3) i don't know the source of the "python: file not found" error.
4) If something doesn't work, try adding time.sleep(3) after the inititalization
----> GOT IT. WTF. The following will work almost every time:
     from time import sleep
     But this will always crash:
     import time
is 'time' somehow a global variable?!
5) Sometimes things simply stop working. It's like rtcmix gets a buffer confused 
and has to wait a few minutes before it can be used again...
    --> But somehow arpeggiate always seems to work.
