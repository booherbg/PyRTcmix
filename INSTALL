Install Instructions.

For all of these steps in one place, check out install_everything.sh

0) Install the python packages 'python-setuptools', 'python-dev' and 'cython'. If these are
unavailable to you, see the README on how to use the Makefile
1) Download the latest rtcmix
   -- apply the patch that allows pyRTcmix to work. This is the only kind of tricky
      part. Point the patch at your rtcmix source directory, like this:
         $ patch -d ~/src/RTcmix-all-092811/src/rtcmix/ < ~/src/PyRTCmix/load_utils.c.patch
   -- ./configure (in the rtcmix source directory)
   -- (for linux only: add the following to site.conf)
      OPT=-fPIC -O2
   -- make
2) edit setup.py so that it has the correct path to RTcmix's source folder
3) python setup.py build_ext     or      python setup.py install

if all went well, you will have a PyRTCmix.so inside your build folder, and
if you ran 'install' it'll be available on your python path

To test, run "python examples/arpeggiate.py"
